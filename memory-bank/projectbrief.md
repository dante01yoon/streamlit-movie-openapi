# Project Brief: Streamlit + OpenAPI Playground

## Overview
This project is a practical implementation of **Chapter 16: Using External Data**. It aims to build a web-based playground where users can interact with external data sources via **APIs** (e.g., Movie Database) and **Web Crawling** (e.g., News Search), visualized through **Streamlit**.

## Core Requirements
1.  **Movie Dashboard**:
    -   Fetch daily box office data from KOBIS API.
    -   Visualize top 10 movies with audience counts.
2.  **News Scraper (Optional/Extension)**:
    -   Scrape news headlines using Playwright.
    -   Display results to the user.
3.  **Memory Bank**:
    -   Maintain project context and progress in `memory-bank/`.

## Goals
-   Demonstrate how to connect Python (Streamlit) with external APIs.
-   Showcase data visualization without complex frontend code.
-   Provide a template for "Data Dashboards".
