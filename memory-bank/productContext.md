# Product Context

## Why this project exists
This project serves as an educational example and a starter template for building data-driven applications using **Streamlit**. It helps developers understand:
-   How to fetch data from REST APIs.
-   How to handle JSON responses.
-   How to visualize data easily.
-   How to use Headless Browsers (Playwright) for data extraction when APIs are missing.

## User Experience (UX) Goals
-   **Simplicity**: Minimal user input (pick a date, click a button).
-   **Feedback**: Clear loading states (spinners) and error messages.
-   **Visuals**: Immediate visual gratification through charts.
